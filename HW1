Ex:
    1. select sum(throughput),
              extract(hour from datetime) as hour
       from hw1.rides2017
       group by hour;
    
    2. select origin, destination 
       from hw1.rides2017
       where extract(dow from datetime) between 1 and 5
       group by origin, destination
       order by sum(throughput) desc
       limit 1;

    3. select destination
       from hw1.rides2017
       where extract(dow from datetime) = 1 and extract(hour from datetime) between 7 and 10
       group by destination
       order by sum(throughput)
       limit 5;
