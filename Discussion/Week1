    View, add, update, and delete data

Relational Data Model:
    What is relation: A collection of relations(tables)
    Each table consists of rows and columns
    column: Attribute
    row: record, tuple
    superkey: set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple
    Any superset of superkey will be a superkey
    candidates keys: A superkey with the fewest attribute
    Primary key: A candidate key chosen by the database designer
    composite primary keys: primary key with multiple attributes
    Foreign key: An attribute that ties the tuples of two relations together into one
                 A foreign key in a relation r1 does not uniquely identify a tuple in r1, but
                 does in the referred relation r2
