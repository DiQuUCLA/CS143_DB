Join
    R1 = R2 * R3 under condition c
Natural Join
    Join two relations using common attribute names
    if we don't have common attribute names, it becomes cartisian product
Union
    Concatenate two sets of tuples that have the same structure(not schema)
So is intersection
Aggregation:
    G1 Y F(A1) (R1)
    G1: attribute(s)
    apply the function F on attribute A1 in relation R1

Evaluation Order:
    1. From
    2. Where
    3. Group by
    4. Having
    5. Order
    6. Select

Tables in From clause:
    cross product, not natural join
