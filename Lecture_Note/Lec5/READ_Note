Nested Subqueries
    A select-from-where expression that is nested within another query
    we use in to represent Set Membership
    e.g.
        select distinct course_id
        from section
        where semester = 'Fall' and year=2017 and
            course_id in (select course_id
                          from section
                          where semester = 'Spring' and year = 2018);
    Or
        select distinc name
        from instructor
        where name not in ('Mozart', 'Einstein')
    use comparison with some and all to represent Set comparison
    e.g.
        select name
        from instructor
        where salary > some (select salary
                             from instructor
                             where dept_name = 'Biology');
    Or
        select name
        from instructor
        where salary > all (select salary
                            from instructor
                            where dept_name = 'Biology');

    One way to find the max:
    select dept_name
    from instructor
    group by dept_name
    having avg(salary) >= all (select avg(salary)
                               from instructor
                               group by dept_name);

    or except with exist
    "Find all student who have taken all courses offered in the Biology department"
    select S.ID, S.name
    from student as S
    where not exists ((select course_id
                       from course
                       where dept_name = 'Biology')
                     except
                     (select T.course_id
                     from takes as T
                     where S.ID = T.ID));

    with:
        with max_budget(value) as
            (select max(budget)
             from department)
        select budget
        from department, max_budget
        where department.budget = max_budget.value;
