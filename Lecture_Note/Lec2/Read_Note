View of Data:
    Data Models: a collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data 
            semantics, and consistency constraints. 
        Relational Model:
            A collection of tables to represent both data and relationsips among data. Each 
          table has multiple columns. Tables are know as relations. --record-based model. 
        Entity-Relationship Model:
            E-R data model uses a collection of basic objs, called entities and relationships
          among these objects
        Semi-structured Data Model:
            same type of data may have different sets of attributes
        Object-Based Data Model

Data abstraction:
    Physical level: The lowest level to describe how the data are actualy stored
    Logical level: The next level to describe what data are stored in the database and what relationships exist among data
    View level: The highest level to describe part of the entire database. 

Instance and Schemas:
    instance: collection of information stored in the database at a particular moment
    schema: The overall design of the database

Database Languages:
    data-definition language(DDL)
    data-manipulation language(DML)

    DDL:
        Domain Constraints: domain of values that can be associated with certain attribute
        Referential Integrity: a value that appears in one relation also appears in a certain set of attr
        Authorization: read/insert/update/delete authorization

    SQL data-definition language:
        How SQL defines department table:
            create table department
                (dept_name  char(20)
                 building   char(15)
                 budget     numeric(12, 2));
    DML:
        Retrieval of information stored in the database
        Insertion of new information into the database
        Deletion of information from the databse
        Modification of information stored in the database

    two types of DML:
        Procedural DMLs: specify what data are needed and how to get those data
        Declarative DMLs what data are needed without specifying how to get those data

    A query is a stmt requesting the retrieval of information
    The portion of a DML that involves information retrieval is called a query language

    The SQL data-manipulation language:
        it is nonprocedural. 
            select instructor.name
            from instructor
            where instructor.dept_name = 'History'

    Storage Manager:
        Authorization and integrity manager
        Transaction manager
        File manager
        Buffer manager

Structure of Relational Database:
    A relational database consists of a collection of tables
    A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values
    A tuple is simply a sequence of values

For all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r must be atomic.
A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units
