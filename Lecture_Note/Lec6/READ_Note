Natural Join:
    natural join only considers those pairs of tuples with the same value on
    those attributes that appears in both relations
    SQL:
        select name, course_id
        from student natural join takes;

    For more than 2 attributes' natural join:
        select name, title
        from student natural join takes, course
        where takes.course_id = course.course_id
    suppose student doesn't have the attribute course_id
    then this is different from
        select name, title
        from student natural join take natural join course;
    Since natural join will only consider the all common attributes, but 
    student doesn't have attribute course_id

    introduce join ... using
    select name, title
    from (student natural join takes) join course using (course_id);
    It will specify which attributes are used during join(Cartisian product)

Join Conditions:
    Similar to using, we can do join ... on(on is like where)
        select *
        from student join takes on student.ID = takes.ID
    It is equivalent to following:
        select *
        from student, takes
        where student.ID = takes.ID;

Outer Joins:
    Outer join perservers those tuples that would be lost in a natural join
    
    left outer join: perservers tuples only in the relation named before the op
    The right outer join preserves tuples only in the relation named after op
    Full outer join preserves all tuples

    The remaining in other relation will be NULL

    select *
    from student natural left outer join takes;


Views:
    SQL allows a virtual relation to be defined by a query
    A virtual relation is not precomputed and stored 
    It is computed by executing the query when it is used
    In SQL:
        create view v as <query expression>;
        e.g.
        create view faculty as
            select ID, name, dept_name
            from instructor;

Transactions:
    a sequence of query and/or update statements.
    Commit work:
        the updates become permanent in the database
    Rollback work:
        the current transaction will be rolled back
